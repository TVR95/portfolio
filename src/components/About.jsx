                <p>Iâ€™m a web developer opened for new opportunities that begins his journey as a professional programmer. I have been studying programming for about one year already. In that time span I was able to learn fundamentals required to develop further as a programmer. Now I am able to enlarge my knowledge using learned fundamentals what allows me to understand better any documentation and to search properly for needed answer. In my future work I would like to focus on back-end of projects based on Java and node.js. My hobbies are languages, video games and web development. My favorite language to learn is Japanese and I hope to master that one day. Video games that I enjoy are strategy games and I can talk about them pretty much all the time. In web development I take joy in process of making an entire web page to look and to work the way I want it what is really satisfying for me.</p>
