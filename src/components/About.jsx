                <p>I am self-taught web developer looking for new opportunities to enhance my skill set. In the beginning of my programmer journey I was studying android development but I couldnâ€™t find enough passion to continue learning it. After that I decided to learn about web development what turned out to be my new main interest. There is always something new to learn and practise what is great about that. My favourite front-end framework is React because of React Hooks what makes code a lot easier to write and read. Second framework that I decided to learn was Angular which implements everything in one framework and that is what I like the most about Angular. Afterwards I went to back-end where I was learning node.js with express that allowed me to practice developing dynamic websites and SQL with NoSQL Databases. Besides web development my biggest hobbies are video games and languages. My favorite language at the moment is Japanese that taught me that even something hard can be super fun to learn and practice. </p>
